// JS engine is present in browsers, which helps in to run js program - client side
// JS after getting merged with a C++ program called node, so it can now be used outside browser - server side

// Execution Environment:
// Java: Java applications are typically compiled into bytecode, which can run on any platform that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This makes Java platform-independent ("write once, run anywhere").
// JavaScript: JavaScript code is executed by web browsers natively. Additionally, JavaScript can also run on servers (using Node.js) or in other environments (like IoT devices) using runtime environments other than browsers.

// Usage:
// Java: Java is widely used in enterprise environments, especially for building large-scale applications and systems. It is also popular for Android app development.
// JavaScript: JavaScript is primarily used for web development, powering the interactivity of websites and web applications. It is also increasingly used for server-side development (with Node.js) and in various other contexts beyond the web.

--------------------------types of variables
// var: Variables declared with var are function-scoped or globally scoped. They are accessible throughout the entire function in which they are defined, regardless of block scope.
// var: Allows re-declaration of variables within the same scope. 
// let: Variables declared with let are block-scoped. They are only accessible within the block (enclosed by curly braces) in which they are defined.
// let: Does not allow re-declaration of variables within the same scope. 

// const: unchangeable value

---------------------------Primitive data types
// String - sequence of Characters
// Number - integers, floating
// Boolean -
// undefined - undefined represents a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value.
//             let x;
//             console.log(x); // Output: undefined
// null -      It is often used to explicitly indicate that a variable does not have a meaningful value.
//             Unlike undefined, null is explicitly assigned to a variable to signify that it has no value.
