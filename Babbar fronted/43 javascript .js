// JS engine is present in browsers, which helps in to run js program - client side
// JS after getting merged with a C++ program called node, so it can now be used outside browser - server side

// Execution Environment:
// Java: Java applications are typically compiled into bytecode, which can run on any platform that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This makes Java platform-independent ("write once, run anywhere").
// JavaScript: JavaScript code is executed by web browsers natively. Additionally, JavaScript can also run on servers (using Node.js) or in other environments (like IoT devices) using runtime environments other than browsers.

// Usage:
// Java: Java is widely used in enterprise environments, especially for building large-scale applications and systems. It is also popular for Android app development.
// JavaScript: JavaScript is primarily used for web development, powering the interactivity of websites and web applications. It is also increasingly used for server-side development (with Node.js) and in various other contexts beyond the web.
